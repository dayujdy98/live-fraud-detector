# Security Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive security scanning tools and documentation for the Live Fraud Detection System, demonstrating enterprise-grade security practices suitable for deployment at top-tier AI/ML companies.

## Security Overview

Our MLOps system implements **defense-in-depth security** across multiple layers:

- **Application Security**: Secure coding practices, input validation, error handling
- **Dependency Security**: Regular vulnerability scanning and updates
- **Container Security**: Hardened images, minimal attack surface
- **Infrastructure Security**: VPC isolation, IAM least privilege, encryption
- **Data Security**: Encryption at rest and in transit, secure data handling
- **Network Security**: Security groups, load balancer configurations
- **Operational Security**: Monitoring, logging, incident response

## Security Scanning Tools

### Python Code Security
- **[Bandit](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/)**: Identifies common security issues in Python code
- **[Semgrep](https://semgrep.dev/)**: Advanced static analysis for security vulnerabilities
- **Coverage**: SQL injection, command injection, hardcoded secrets, insecure protocols

### Dependency Security
- **[Safety](https://pyup.io/safety/)**: Scans Python dependencies for known vulnerabilities
- **[pip-audit](https://pypi.org/project/pip-audit/)**: Audits Python packages for known security vulnerabilities
- **Coverage**: CVE database matching, license compliance, outdated packages

### Container Security
- **[Trivy](https://trivy.dev/)**: Comprehensive container and filesystem vulnerability scanner
- **Coverage**: OS packages, language-specific packages, container misconfigurations

### Infrastructure Security
- **[tfsec](https://github.com/aquasecurity/tfsec)**: Static analysis for Terraform configurations
- **[gitleaks](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks)**: Secrets detection in Git repositories
- **Coverage**: Cloud misconfigurations, exposed secrets, compliance violations

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Security Tools
```bash
# Install Python security tools
pip install bandit safety semgrep pip-audit

# Install container security scanner
brew install trivy  # macOS
# or
curl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aquasecurity/trivy/main/contrib/install.sh | sh -s -- -b /usr/local/bin

# Install infrastructure security tools
brew install tfsec gitleaks  # macOS
```

### 2. Run Security Scans

```bash
# Comprehensive security scan (recommended)
./security/security-scan.sh

# Quick scan (Bandit + Safety only)
./security/security-scan.sh quick

# Dependencies only
./security/security-scan.sh deps
```

### 3. Review Results
Security reports are generated in `security/reports/` with timestamps:
- **Consolidated Report**: `security_report_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.md`
- **Individual Tool Reports**: JSON and text formats for each scanner

##  Security Scan Results

### Key Security Achievements

####  **Application Security Excellence**
- **Zero SQL injection vulnerabilities**: Parameterized queries and ORM usage
- **No hardcoded secrets**: Environment-based configuration management
- **Input validation**: Comprehensive request validation with Pydantic
- **Error handling**: Secure error responses without information disclosure

####  **Dependency Security Management**
- **Automated vulnerability scanning**: Integrated into CI/CD pipeline
- **Regular updates**: Dependency update monitoring and management
- **License compliance**: No GPL or restrictive license dependencies
- **Minimal dependencies**: Only necessary packages included

####  **Container Security Hardening**
- **Minimal base images**: Alpine Linux for reduced attack surface
- **No root execution**: Non-privileged container execution
- **Layer optimization**: Multi-stage builds for minimal final image
- **Regular updates**: Base image update automation

####  **Infrastructure Security Design**
- **VPC isolation**: Private subnets for compute resources
- **IAM least privilege**: Role-based access with minimal permissions
- **Encryption everywhere**: TLS 1.3, AES-256 encryption at rest
- **Network segmentation**: Security groups with restrictive rules

##  Security Best Practices Implemented

### Secure Development Lifecycle
1. **Static Code Analysis**: Automated security scanning in CI/CD
2. **Dependency Scanning**: Regular vulnerability assessments
3. **Container Scanning**: Image vulnerability analysis
4. **Infrastructure as Code Security**: Terraform security validation

### Runtime Security
1. **Application Monitoring**: Real-time security event detection
2. **Access Logging**: Comprehensive audit trails
3. **Anomaly Detection**: Unusual pattern identification
4. **Incident Response**: Automated alerting and response procedures

### Data Protection
1. **Encryption**: AES-256 encryption for data at rest
2. **TLS 1.3**: Modern encryption for data in transit
3. **Access Controls**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
4. **Data Minimization**: Collect only necessary data

##  Compliance & Standards

Our security implementation aligns with industry standards expected at top-tier AI/ML companies:

### **SOC 2 Type II Compliance Ready**
- Access controls and authentication
- System monitoring and logging
- Change management processes
- Incident response procedures

### **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**
- **Identify**: Asset inventory and risk assessment
- **Protect**: Access controls and data protection
- **Detect**: Continuous monitoring and anomaly detection
- **Respond**: Incident response and recovery procedures
- **Recover**: Business continuity and disaster recovery

### **Cloud Security Best Practices**
- **AWS Well-Architected Security Pillar**: Identity/access management, detection, data protection
- **Container Security**: CIS Docker Benchmark compliance
- **Infrastructure Security**: CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark alignment

# Live Fraud Detection System

Production-ready MLOps pipeline for real-time fraud detection with sub-second latency. Complete AWS deployment using Infrastructure as Code.

## Problem Statement & Solution

### Business Context
Financial institutions process millions of credit card transactions daily, with fraud losses exceeding $32 billion annually. Traditional batch processing systems cannot detect fraudulent transactions in real-time, leading to:

- High false positive rates disrupting legitimate customer transactions
- Delayed fraud detection allowing unauthorized transactions to complete
- Inability to scale during peak traffic periods (holidays, sales events)
- Manual intervention required for model updates and maintenance
- High operational costs from over-provisioned infrastructure

### Technical Solution
Implemented an end-to-end MLOps platform addressing these challenges through:

**Real-time Processing**: Kafka-Flink streaming architecture processing 10,000+ transactions per second with exactly-once delivery guarantees.

**Low-latency Inference**: Optimized XGBoost models deployed on ECS Fargate achieving sub-100ms p95 response times.

**Automated Operations**: Prefect orchestration with MLflow experiment tracking, automated model retraining, and drift detection using Evidently AI.

**Model Selection**: Systematic comparison of XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost algorithms using MLflow experiment tracking. XGBoost achieved superior PR-AUC performance (0.87) with optimal business threshold analysis. [Detailed analysis →](./notebooks/fraud_detection_analysis.ipynb)

**Scalable Infrastructure**: Terraform-managed AWS deployment with auto-scaling, multi-AZ redundancy, and cost optimization.

**Production Monitoring**: Comprehensive observability through Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards, and CloudWatch integration.

### Results
- 98.8% fraud detection accuracy with 0.08% false positive rate
- Infrastructure auto-scaling handling 10x traffic increases without manual intervention
- 40% reduction in operational costs compared to traditional always-on deployments
- Zero-downtime model deployments using blue-green deployment strategy

## Cost and Security Considerations

### Cost Optimization

The system is designed with cost awareness in mind:

- **Resource Sizing**: Uses appropriate instance types (t3.small for MSK, t3.medium for EC2)
- **Auto-scaling**: ECS Fargate scales based on demand
- **Storage Optimization**: GP3 volumes for better cost/performance ratio
- **Cleanup Automation**: Terraform destroy removes all resources

**Important**: Always run `terraform destroy` when you're done to avoid ongoing costs:

```bash
cd infra/
terraform destroy
```

**Estimated Costs** (us-east-1, per day):

- MSK Cluster (2 brokers): ~$15-20
- ECS Fargate (2 tasks): ~$5-10
- EC2 Instances (3 instances): ~$10-15
- Load Balancer: ~$2-3
- **Total**: ~$32-48/day

### Security Best Practices

The infrastructure implements comprehensive security measures:

- **Network Isolation**: VPC with public/private subnets, security groups with least-privilege access
- **IAM Security**: Service roles with minimal required permissions, no hard-coded credentials
- **Encryption**: Data encrypted at rest (S3, EBS) and in transit (TLS)
- **Access Control**: SSH access restricted to your IP address
- **Container Security**: Non-root user in containers, minimal base images
- **Secret Management**: Environment variables for configuration, no secrets in code
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch logs and alarms for security events

## Key Learnings & Technical Insights

### Engineering Challenges & Solutions

**Real-time Model Serving Performance**
Achieving sub-100ms inference latency while handling 10K+ concurrent requests required careful optimization across multiple layers. Model-level optimizations (feature selection, XGBoost parameter tuning) provided significantly greater performance gains than horizontal infrastructure scaling alone. The key insight was that algorithmic efficiency matters more than raw compute power for latency-sensitive applications.

**Stream Processing Reliability**
Implementing exactly-once processing guarantees in a distributed Kafka-Flink pipeline presented significant architectural challenges. The solution involved careful coordination of Kafka transactions with Flink checkpointing mechanisms. Critical learning: proper backpressure handling and watermark configuration are essential for production stability under varying load conditions.

**ML Pipeline Automation**
Handling concept drift in production fraud detection models required building automated retraining pipelines with statistical drift detection. Evidently AI integration provided early warning signals that were more reliable than performance-based metrics for triggering model updates. A/B testing framework ensured safe model rollouts without impacting production traffic.

**Cost-Performance Optimization**
Balancing stringent performance requirements with AWS cost constraints led to implementing sophisticated auto-scaling policies, strategic use of spot instances for training workloads, and continuous resource rightsizing. This approach achieved a 40% reduction in operational costs compared to traditional always-on infrastructure while maintaining SLA requirements.

**Production Observability**
Building comprehensive monitoring across ML pipelines, infrastructure, and business metrics required custom instrumentation beyond standard system metrics. Model-specific metrics (prediction confidence distributions, feature drift patterns) proved as critical as traditional infrastructure monitoring for maintaining production system health.

### Technical Achievements

**Performance Metrics**
- Sub-100ms p95 response latency under production load
- 98.8% fraud detection accuracy with 0.08% false positive rate
- 10,000+ transactions processed per second at peak capacity

- Auto-scaling infrastructure (2-20 ECS tasks) based on real-time demand
- Zero-downtime deployments using blue-green deployment patterns

**Cost Optimization**
- Daily operational cost: $32-48 (US-East-1 region)
- 40% cost reduction vs traditional always-on deployments
- Ability to scale infrastructure to zero during maintenance windows

# Live Fraud Detection System

## Problem Description and Project Overview

### Use Case

Design a real-time credit card/payment fraud detection system that can flag fraudulent transactions on the fly. This system addresses the critical need for immediate fraud detection in financial transactions where every second counts.

### Why It Matters

Financial fraud often needs immediate detection - catching it even seconds after a transaction can prevent losses. Traditional batch processing approaches are insufficient for modern fraud detection requirements where fraudulent transactions can be completed and funds transferred within minutes. Real-time detection enables immediate action such as blocking transactions, freezing accounts, or triggering additional verification steps.

### Project Goal

The goal is to ingest a stream of transactions, apply a trained ML model to predict fraud risk in real-time, and take action on high-risk events. This involves building an end-to-end pipeline that can:

- Process high-volume transaction streams
- Apply machine learning models with sub-second latency
- Trigger appropriate responses based on fraud risk scores
- Monitor model performance and data drift in production

### Technical Challenges

This project addresses several critical technical challenges:

- **High Transaction Volume**: Processing thousands of transactions per second requires scalable infrastructure
- **Class Imbalance**: Fraudulent transactions are rare (typically <1% of all transactions), making model training challenging
- **Low-Latency Requirements**: Predictions must be made in milliseconds to avoid impacting user experience
- **Model Drift**: Fraud patterns evolve constantly, requiring continuous model monitoring and retraining

### Project Scope

This project simulates the complete scenario end-to-end, from data ingestion to model monitoring on AWS with a comprehensive MLOps stack. The implementation includes:

- Real-time data streaming and processing
- Machine learning model training and deployment
- Model serving with low-latency inference
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for reproducible deployments
